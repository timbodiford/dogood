## Future enhancements:
 * Add ability for Volunteers to sign-up for events, as well as remove themselves.  Can currently only associate volunteers to events through admin portal locally.
 * Add ability for volunteer to SEARCH for events based on category keyword.
 * Add ability to email a confirmation to the volunteer after successfully signing up for an event.
 * For events added to a volunteer I can only pull in the id of the event.  Need to associate to event details to pull in other event data.
 * Add the ability for the org to see which volunteers have signed up for each event.
